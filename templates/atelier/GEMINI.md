# Atelier AI Context

## Overview
This is the root atelier directory containing multiple artist workspaces. Each artist has their own studio with individual canvas projects.

## Current Artists
<!-- AI context about artists in this atelier will be maintained here -->

## Atelier Structure
- **README.md**: General information about this atelier
- **GEMINI.md**: This AI context file
- **Artist Directories**: Individual artist workspaces

## Development Patterns
- Use `atelier init <artist> <canvas>` to create new projects
- Use `artist init <artist>` to add new artists
- Each artist directory contains their own GEMINI.md for project-specific context

## AI Collaboration Guidelines
- Update this file when new artists or major changes occur
- Each artist should maintain their own AI context in their directory
- Use this space to track atelier-wide patterns and conventions
