# Project Canvas

Welcome to your Project Canvas! 🖼️

This is your actual development workspace - a complete, independent software project with its own Git repository.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Project canvases** are self-contained software projects within the atelier/artist/canvas architecture. Each canvas:
- Has its own independent Git repository
- Can be developed, tested, and deployed separately
- Maintains its own dependencies and configurations
- Is organized thematically within an artist workspace

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Set up your environment**: Install dependencies, configure tools
2. **Explore the codebase**: Review existing code and documentation
3. **Start developing**: Add features, fix bugs, write tests
4. **Commit regularly**: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: your changes"`

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Keep source code in `src/` directory
- Place tests in `tests/` directory
- Use `docs/` for project documentation
- Follow your team's coding standards

### Git Workflow
- **Independent repository**: This canvas has its own Git history
- **Regular commits**: Commit early and often
- **Descriptive messages**: Use clear commit messages
- **Branch strategy**: Use feature branches for new work

### Best Practices
- ✅ Write tests for new features
- ✅ Update documentation as you go
- ✅ Keep dependencies up to date
- ✅ Follow security best practices
- ✅ Review code before committing
