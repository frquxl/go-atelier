# Little log of ideas to capture while they come up

2. Add a cool app in vangogh suinflowers canvas just for the fun of it 

3. Add another cool app in canvas -example that somehoe changes each time it is generated otherwise they will all be the same in each artists added! 

4. "fork" an atelier, artist or canvas, a cli command to make a new one based on another

5. look at wiki-go it might be the ideal md front end

6. cli command to move canvases between artists, e.g there could be a cloud functions artist that handles production, and we might want to move from a dev artist to production 

7. we could have a few predefiend artisits like "sketch" for sandbox, "gallery" for production, maybe "go" for golang expert etc
