# 🌻 Canvas: Sunflowers

_"The heart of man is very much like the sea, it has its storms, it has its tides and in its depths it has its pearls too."_

Welcome to your Project Canvas, a space inspired by the vibrant and enduring spirit of Vincent van Gogh. 🖼️

This is a small, interactive example to spark your creativity.

### 💌 A Letter from Theo

This canvas includes a special interactive CLI named **`vincent`**. It is a small tribute to the bond between brothers, filled with words from their letters.

To get a random quote from Vincent's letters to his brother Theo, run:

```bash
./vincent theo loved-me
```

---

This canvas was made with the Cobra CLI library for Go. Vincent invites you to start your own canvas and explore the power of CLI-driven development.

To begin your own creation, try `atelier-cli canvas init <your-canvas-name>` from within an artist's directory.

Happy coding! 🚀✨
