# Artist Workspace

Welcome to your Artist workspace! 👨‍🎨

This artist workspace contains multiple project canvases, each representing a different software development project. Think of this as your personal studio containing various paintings (projects) you're working on.

## 🎯 Artist Purpose

**Artist workspaces** group related projects together thematically. This could be:
- Projects using the same technology stack
- Projects for the same client or organization
- Projects sharing similar goals or patterns
- Personal projects with common themes

## 📁 Canvas Projects

This artist contains the following project canvases:
```

```

## 🚀 Working with Canvases

Each canvas in this artist workspace is:
- ✅ **Independent Git repository** - develop without affecting other projects
- ✅ **Isolated environment** - own dependencies and configurations
- ✅ **Version controlled** - track changes and collaborate
- ✅ **Self-contained** - complete project with its own documentation

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. **Choose a canvas**: `cd canvas-project-name`
2. **Work independently**: Each canvas has its own Git history
3. **Commit changes**: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: your changes"`
4. **Push updates**: `git push origin main`

## 🎨 Artist Philosophy

Think of yourself as an artist in a studio:
- **Atelier**: The entire workspace/studio
- **Artist**: Your personal area within the studio (this level)
- **Canvas**: Individual paintings/projects you're working on

Each canvas represents a complete, independent project that you can develop, deploy, and maintain separately while being organized thematically within this artist workspace.

## 📚 Documentation

- **README.md**: Human-readable artist and project overview (this file)
- **GEMINI.md**: AI pair programming context for this artist's projects

Keep creating! 🎨
